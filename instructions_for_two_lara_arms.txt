=== Multimaster instructions for two Lara arms ===


The multimaster package requires that in each ros network there is a discovery node and a sync node running.

1. In a terminal window where you connected to one of the Lara master: run $roslaunch fkie_master_discovery master_discovery_lara1.launch
2. In a terminal window where you are connected to the other Lara master: run $roslaunch fkie_master_discovery master_discovery_lara2.launch
(- The only difference between these launch files is the port they use for the discovery node, since these need to be different when running on the same machine)
3. Adapt the master_sync_lara1.launch and master_sync_lara2.launch files to specify which topics you would like to be able to receive from the other ros network(s)
4. In a terminal window where you connected to one of the Lara master: run $roslaunch fkie_master_sync master_sync_lara1.launch
5. In a terminal window where you are connected to the other Lara master: run $roslaunch fkie_master_sync master_sync_lara2.launch
6. You should now be able to directly receive the specified topics from the other ros network with practically no delay
